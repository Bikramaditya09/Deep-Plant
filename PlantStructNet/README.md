## Dependency

* The codes are based on [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Dataset
* The [PlantClef2015 dataset](http://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2015/plant) used has 1000 plant species classes. Training and testing data comprise 91759 and 21446 images respectively.

* All the training and testing images are grouped into their respective observation ID (Tagged in PlantClef2015 dataset). Note that, plant images captured from a same plant are tagged with different mediaIDs but the same observation ID.

* Please download the:

	1. Precomputed fc7 features at [this https URL (for training)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QMzjPusNnXSMlBUpP6KbKxk6O9N6DnCi/view?usp=sharing)(size = 3Gb) and at [this https URL (for testing)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1djPGne957wnxW3yTG40X49ppqHH3fShc/view?usp=sharing)(size = 200Mb).

	2. Preorganised observationID files ``` obs_mediaID.7z ``` from the Dataset folder. It consists of .mat files that named after plant ObservationIDs. Each .mat file consists of B cell that stores the information of the respective mediaIDs.

	3. Lists of ObservationIDs and ground truth species classes from the Dataset folder:
	* test_obs_list.mat
	* test_obs_class.mat
	* train_obs_list.mat
	* train_obs_class.mat


## Installation and Running

1. Users are required to install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Library.

2. Users are required to download the necessary files and data according to the aforementioned dataset section for a fair comparison to our proposed models.

3. Users can train the model from scratch by running the main.py which includes ``` temp_createStruct2_2.py ``` and ``` Var_seq2seq_classification_bidirectRNN.py ```.

4. Users can test the trained model prepared in the 'model' folder.


Note that users are expected to modify the corresponding files to correct path to work properly. Enjoy!
